 Interactive entertainment is a rapidly evolving industry with significant social and cultural consequences. FHW, following this tendency, organizes a conference which will constitute the supreme academic forum for the presentation of new research results that will come from the field of entertainment computing. This year’s organization incorporates DIMEA, which in the last three years has established itself as a very important conference of entertainment and art.  
 It is worth noting that apart from the theoretical approaches that will lead to constructive dialogue, the conference is expected to include a Creative Demo Session, with on-the-spot presentation of more than twenty experiments-projects in the field of interactive entertainment coming from the most important research groups in the world. In the end of the conference, the best experimental projects will be awarded

  Submission Instructions  
 Similar to previous years, ACML 2023 has two publication tracks  . Authors may submit either to:  
 Conference Track: | (16-page limit with references) for which the proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR). 
  Journal Track: | (20-page limit with references) for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of the Springer Machine Learning Journal (MLJ). 
  Please note that submission procedures for the two tracks are different. Please read the instructions carefully before submitting.    
 Conference Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 30, 2023  June 23, 2023   For the conference track, please submit your manuscript via CMT at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023  .  
 IMPORTANT:   When creating a new submission on CMT, please ensure you choose the ""Conference""  track.  
 The Latex submission template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_submission_template.zip  .  
  The Latex camera-ready template and style file can be found here: ACML2023_camera-ready_template.zip  .  
 Manuscripts must be written in English, be a maximum of 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) and follow the PMLR style. If required, supplementary material may be submitted as a separate file, but reviewers are not obliged to consider this.  
 All conference track submissions must be anonymized  . Submissions that are not anonymized, over-length, or not in the correct format will be rejected without review. To anonymize, simply leave the author information empty in the Tex template. There is no separate format for anonymizing.  
 It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv) as long as it is not cited in the submission.  
 Journal Track  
 Submission Deadline: June 02, 2023  May 26, 2023   In addition to the conference track, this year’s ACML will run a journal track, similar to previous years. Papers that are accepted to the journal track must be presented at the conference in order to be published.  
 IMPORTANT:   Similar to previous years, for the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously   for the purpose of review management:  
 First, please submit ONLY the title and abstract via CMT at: | https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACML2023. | (paper manuscript need not be submitted here). When creating the submission on CMT, please choose the | ""Journal"" | track. 
  Then, please submit the paper via Springer’s Editorial Manager system at: | https://www.editorialmanager.com/mach. | When creating a new submission on Springer’s Editorial Manager, please make sure to choose | ""S.I.: ACML 2023"" | as the article type. 
  For the journal track, manuscripts must be written in English with a maximum of 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). For the template and style files, please follow the instructions for authors on the journal website: https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994  .  
 The journal track will follow the reviewing process of the Machine Learning journal. This includes allowing papers that require minor changes to be resubmitted after a first-round review. The journal track committee will aim to complete the reviewing process in time for this year’s conference. In the unlikely event that the reviewing process for a paper is not completed in time (for this year’s conference), the paper will not be considered for the conference and the review will be completed as a regular submission to the Machine Learning journal.  
 The journal track review is single-blind, i.e., the authors’ identity will be visible to reviewers. It is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Submissions that are not in the correct format will be rejected without review. In addition, extended versions of published conference papers are not eligible for journal track submission. However, submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Also, submission is permitted for papers that are available as a technical report (e.g., in arXiv).

 Abstract  
 en    
   
 This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Abstract State Machines, B, TLA, VDM and Z, which took place in Toulouse, France, in June 2014. The 13 full papers presented together with 3 invited talks and 19 short papers were carefully reviewed and selected from 81 submissions. The ABZ conference series is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of six related state-based and machine-based formal methods: Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z. They share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The main goal of this conference series is to contribute to the integration of these formal methods, clarifying their commonalities and differences to better understand how to combine different approaches for accomplishing the various tasks in modeling, experimental validation and mathematical verification of reliable high-quality hardware/software systems.

 About IITH      
   
 Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) is a premier institute of science and technology established in 2008. IITH has been consistently ranked in the top 10 institutes in India for Engineering according to NIRF making it one of the most coveted schools for science and technology in the country. IITH offers undergraduate programs in all the classical engineering disciplines, applied sciences, design, as well as several modern interdisciplinary areas. Students are given a flexibility to explore a broad set of areas, and potentially pursue a minor or double major in a discipline that is not their own. Students who wish to seek a deeper understanding of their own discipline are strongly encouraged to get involved in cutting-edge research with the help of a faculty to mentor them, and earn an Honors in their own field. The very foundation of IIT Hyderabad is based on research and innovation. The vibrant research culture is evident from the number of patents and publications that IITH produces consistently every year. IITH offers graduate programs at both a masters, and a doctoral level, in several diverse areas. There are separate programs for technology, design, science, and liberal arts. The MTech program is offered in various modes and durations to cater to the ever-growing need of postgraduate level professionals in the country. IITH encourages and supports innovation and entrepreneurship at every stage. The minor program in entrepreneurship is open to all students of IITH, and many of the courses are offered by industrialists who are entrepreneurs themselves. There are various innovation centers and incubators that promote entrepreneurship and help mentor young innovators. IITH has been very successful in building tie-ups with leading academic institutions around the globe. IITH enjoys a very special relationship with Japanese universities and industries that goes beyond academic and research collaborations. In fact, some of the iconic buildings in IITH campus will carry the signature of Japanese architecture. IITH creates a unique holistic ecosystem for education that offers interactive learning, a very flexible academic structure, cutting-edge research, strong industry collaboration, and entrepreneurship. This is an environment which enables students and faculty to translate their dreams into realities.

  Event | High Integrity Software conference   
 Virtual Nov 17, 2020    The development of high integrity software-based systems is always challenging, and in current times it is an engineering discipline that has had to respond rapidly to a changing global environment. In this context, innovation has become even more essential as we respond to changes in the ways we work, changes in the tools we use on a day-to-day basis, and adapt the technologies we produce as we respond rapidly to changing market demands. This conference has three speakers will present their own perspectives on these challenges – the lessons learned and how the situation will evolve for their organizations as we move forwards. | More Info 
  Event | HILT 2020 Workshop on Safe Languages and Technologies for Structured and Efficient Parallel and Distributed/Cloud Computing.   
 Virtual (was Chicago IL) Nov 16-17, 2020    This is the sixth in the HILT series of conferences and workshops, sponsored by ACM SIGAda, focused on the use of High Integrity Language Technology to address challenging issues in the engineering of highly complex critical software systems. High Integrity Language Technologies have been tackling the challenges of building efficient, safe, reliable software for decades. Critical software as a domain is quickly expanding beyond embedded real-time control applications to the increasing reliance on complex software for the basic functioning of businesses, governments, and society in general. HILT 2020 will focus on the growing importance of large-scale, highly parallel, distributed and/or cloud applications. Single-thread performance is reaching the limits of physics, and this has driven growth in parallel programming, massively distributed systems, and heterogeneous/ accelerated computing models. Once the domain of high-performance computing experts, parallel, distributed, and cloud computing are becoming fundamental technologies for all programmers. This workshop seeks to explore ways High Integrity Language Technologies can bring the capabilities of parallelism, distribution, and heterogeneity to a wider audience, without the associated increase in complexity. | More Info

 ASPLOS 2025 Call for Papers  
  
 Synopsis  
 ASPLOS, the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. It focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. ASPLOS 2025 will take place in March-April 2025 in Rotterdam, co-located with EuroSys 2025.  
 ASPLOS 2025 has three submission deadlines – spring, summer and fall – which are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready. As in recent years, ASPLOS 2025 will allow the authors of some submissions to choose to apply a major revision to their submission in order to fix a well-defined list of problems.

  All deadlines are AoE.   
 Scope and Expectations  
 The scope of ASPLOS 2025 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construes systems  broadly, and areas of interest include, but are not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines. Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome submission of “experience papers” that have a novel component and that clearly articulate the lessons learned. We likewise welcome submissions whereby novelty lies in furthering our understandings of existing systems, e.g., by uncovering previously unknown, valuable insights or by convincingly refuting prior published results and common wisdom. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.  
 Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:  
 Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales 
  Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators 
  Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters 
  Memory, storage, networking, and I/O 
  Power, energy, and thermal management 
  Profiling, debugging, and testing 
  Security, reliability, and availability 
  Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data 
  Virtualization and virtualized systems 
  A good submission will typically: motivate a significant problem; propose a practical solution or approach that makes sense; demonstrate not just the pros but also the cons of the proposal using sound experimental methods; explicitly disclose what has and has not been implemented; articulate the new contributions beyond previous work; and refrain from overclaiming, focusing the abstract and introduction sections primarily on the difference between the new proposal and what is already available. The latter statement should be interpreted broadly to also encompass studies that broaden our understanding of existing systems (rather than suggest new ones), which may constitute a significant problem in its own right. Submissions will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, and clarity. Submissions are expected to adhere to SIGPLAN’s Empirical Evaluation Guidelines  and all the policies specified below.  
 Resubmissions  
 Authors of resubmitted work must describe in a separate note—to be uploaded to the submission site at submission time—the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page.  
 For resubmitted work that received a “Major Revision” followed by a revised submission, the revision also counts as a submission  , so the note should describe changes relative to the revision rather than the original submission.  
 Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next two subsequent review cycles. The corresponding restrictions on ASPLOS ‘25 submissions are thus:  
 Papers rejected in 2024 Spring, or earlier, are now eligible for resubmission to ASPLOS. 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Summer may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Summer (or later). 
  Papers rejected in 2024 Fall may not resubmit until ASPLOS 2025 Fall (or later). 
  These resubmission rules are strict and hold even if a submission has undergone extensive revision. If a paper is withdrawn from an ASPLOS cycle after reviews are made available  , it is considered “rejected” from that cycle (and cannot be resubmitted to the next two cycles).  
 Major Revisions  
 In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2025 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification). These submissions will be provided with clear and actionable reviewer feedback for their revision, and they will be typically reviewed by some of the same reviewers as the original submission. If the revision requirements are satisfactorily met, the revised submission will be accepted.  
 Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements.  
 Accept or reject notifications for spring and summer major revisions will coincide with the notifications of the subsequent cycle. Notifications of fall major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revisions have been resubmitted.  
 Anonymization  
 ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission by avoiding identifying yourself or your institution/affiliation in any of the submitted documents (except in specific fields on the HotCRP submission form designated for this purpose), either explicitly or by implication, e.g., through references, acknowledgments, online repositories that are referenced by the submission, or interaction with committee members.  
 Do not include a “reference removed for blind review” text or similar in your submission. When it is necessary to cite your own studies, cite them as written by a third party. Only if that is not possible, they can be uploaded and cited as anonymized supplemental material (see below). This applies to workshop papers that are being extended by your current ASPLOS submission, and related submissions of your own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy, and some other exceptions apply; see the “originality and concurrent submissions” section below for details.  
 Please make sure not to reveal author and/or affiliation information through side channels and other less obvious means. For example, the metadata included in the PDF should not give away such information. If you’d like to point to a repository of, e.g., the working code of your system (which is great and much appreciated), this repository should, of course, be anonymized. It is okay and often makes sense to create anonymized repositories merely for the sake of an anonymous submission. If your system is already released to the public, rename it in your submission. You should likewise avoid inadvertently revealing affiliation in your submission by identifying your company’s name in situations where, e.g., it is clear that the authors of the submission most probably work for the company that manufactures the device or provides the service that constitutes the topic of your work; instead, please use a generic name, like “a computer server vendor X,” “a cloud service provider Y,” and such like.  
 If concealing system name or affiliation would make your paper difficult to understand, contact the program chairs to discuss exceptions to this policy. Submissions that are not properly anonymized will likely be rejected without review.  
 Anonymized Supplemental Material  
 Supplemental material may be submitted as a single-but-separate anonymized PDF file without page limit. The nature of such material is explained in the above “anonymization” section. We permit uploading such material exclusively for the purpose of handling specific anonymity issues.  
 The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material mechanism should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewers are neither required nor encouraged to read such material when making their decision.  
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest  
 Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected.  
 Both people and institutions (companies, universities, and other relevant organizations) may be declared as having a conflict of interest (COI) with respect to an author. Please declare a COI with the following for any author of your submission; please do so with respect to all your conflicts, not just restricted to program committee (PC) and extended review committee (ERC) members, as we may occasionally ask for external reviews from people outside the PC/ERC.  
 Your current institution(s) and other institutions that you were affiliated with in the past four years relative to the submission deadline; also, an institution that is about to become your employer. 
  Your PhD advisor(s), post-doctoral host(s), PhD students, and post-doctoral advisees; these COIs are forever. 
  Family relations by blood or marriage and close personal friends (who may potentially be reviewers); these COIs are likewise forever. 
  People with whom you have collaborated in the last four years, including co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending paper submissions and co-PIs of accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
  Potential reviewers who shared your primary institution(s) in the last four years, or where one is actively engaged in discussions about employment with the other person’s institution. 
  When there is a direct funding relationship between an author and a potential reviewer (e.g., the reviewer is a sponsor of an author’s research on behalf of his/her company or vice versa). 
  Among PIs of research structures supported under the same umbrella funding award who (1) participate regularly in non-public meetings sponsored by that umbrella award, and (2) are regularly exposed to presentations or discussions of unpublished work at such meetings. 
  Do not declare a COI for the following cases:  
 You must not declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. 
  “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization or an open-source community, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a COI. 
  Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects without direct collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
  Internships constitute a conflict of interest during the period of employment of the intern, but not thereafter, unless some other provision applies (e.g., co-authorship or ongoing research collaboration after the internship). Graduate students are not presumed to have an automatic COI with their undergraduate institution. On the other hand, prospective graduate students do have a COI with any institution they have applied to if they are actively engaged in discussions with any faculty member at that institution. Once they join an institution to pursue graduate studies, automatic COIs with any other prospective institutions sunset. In all these cases, the collaboration COI above still applies. 
  When in doubt, contact the program chairs and ask.  
 Declaring Authors  
 Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.  
 Declaring Areas and Topics  
 ASPLOS emphasizes multidisciplinary research. Submissions should ideally – albeit not necessarily – emphasize synergy of two or more of the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems (broadly interpreted). Authors should therefore indicate at least one of these areas on the submission form and, preferably, more than one.  
 Authors should also indicate on the submission form more focused topics matching their work, which will be used for reviewer assignment.  
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions  
 By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications. Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, web pages, or online repositories such as arxiv.org are not considered prior publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity.  
 The authors additionally guarantee that no manuscript that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted document is or will be under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the ASPLOS review cycle for which it was submitted. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and possibly additional actions against the offending authors.  
 You should also adhere to the ACM Plagiarism Policy ( http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy  ), which covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.  
 As usual, if in doubt, consult with the program chairs.  
 Ethical and Other Obligations  
 Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review. 
  Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members in order to encourage or solicit them to bid on any submission; to attempt to sway a reviewer or PC/ERC member to review any submission positively or negatively; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted manuscripts; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members to ask about the outcomes of any submission. 
  Authors are not allowed to advertise their work during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the results of the review cycle are publicized. The work includes the submission itself and closely related documents such as technical reports or arxiv.org uploads. Advertisement pertains to such communication channels such as social media, community blogs, and web pages. To clarify, authors are indeed allowed to upload their submission to arxiv.org and other such online repositories; the restriction relates to advertising such postings. 
  Authors are not allowed to post in the aforementioned channels about the content of the reviews they may have received until the results of the corresponding review cycle are publicized; “shaming” (and thus potentially applying pressure on) reviewers before the review process terminates is considered unethical. 
  Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ( | https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics | ). 
  Violation of these policies might result in rejection of the submission and possible additional action by the ACM.  
 ACM requires that all submitting authors will be aware of the following policies in particular:  
 By submitting your article to an ACM publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  , including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects  . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
 Formatting and Editing  
 We will use the same format template for submission and camera-ready versions. Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class available on the official ACM site  . Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:  
 % use the base acmart.cls  
  % use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts  
  % nonacm option removes ACM related text in the submission.  
  \documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}  
   
  % enable page numbers  
  \settopmatter{printfolios=true}  
   
  \begin{document}  
  \title{...}  
   
  \begin{abstract}  
  ...  
  \end{abstract}  
   
  \maketitle % should come after the abstract  
   
  % add the paper content here  
   
  % use the ACM bibliography style  
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}  
  \bibliography{...}  
   
  \end{document}  Your final submission should visually look similar to this sample  produced from the zip file above.  
 “Squeezing” Space is Forbidden.  Refrain from tweaking the aforementioned template and from formatting your text in a manner that violates its settings. Notably, refrain from squeezing additional space, e.g., by using \vspace or packages that manipulate vertical space. The template already generates a very dense document, and you must not make it denser. Your submission will be visually and automatically inspected using tools developed for this purpose, and it will be rejected if you violate the formatting policy, even if your PDF passed the HotCRP format check (which is unable to verify much of the requirements).  
 Page Layout and Limit.  Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, footnotes, appendices, etc. The only exception is the bibliographic references section, which is not included in the page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, allowing reviewers to evaluate the work without having to consider any external or supplementary material outside this limit. The reviewers greatly value conciseness, so if you can describe your work with fewer pages than the limit, please do. All pages should be numbered.  
 Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions.  The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such. In addition to this +2 automatic page limit increase, authors of accepted papers may purchase 1–2 more pages, if they wish (payment will be processed when registering to the conference).  
 Font Size, Tables, and Figures.  The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible. In particular, text inside figures/tables should generally use what appears to readers as a 9pt font or bigger after any intra-document scaling has been applied. Fonts appearing smaller than 8pt are not permitted. As noted, this and other requirements are not checked automatically by the HotCRP format checker, so it is the authors’ responsibility to check it. Figures can and should use colors but should also be color-blind friendly and readable when printed in monochrome. Spacing between figures/tables/captions/text should be determined by the latex template.  
 References.  Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers. Also, reviewers will very much appreciate clickable links (preferably DOI  s) associated with each entry in your references section.  
 Specifications.  The following table specifies some of the main typeset requirements. Use our mandatory latex template and follow the above instructions to make sure that these and other formatting requirements are met.  
  
 aspect | requirement 
 file format | PDF with numbered pages 
 page limit | 11 pages, not including references 
 paper size | US Letter 8.5in x 11in 
 top margin | 1in 
 bottom margin | 1in 
 left margin | 0.75in 
 right margin | 0.75in 
 column separation | 0.333in 
 body | 2-column, single-spaced 
 body font size | 10pt 
 abstract font | 10pt 
 section heading font | 12pt, bold 
 subsection heading font | 10pt, bold 
 space between section heading and text | ≥ 6pt 
 caption font | 9pt 
 fonts in figures and tables | ≥ 8pt, preferably ≥ 9pt 
 reference entries | 8pt; no page limit; list full names of all author (no “et al.”); include link to document (preferably DOI  ); make references to citations clickable 
 appendices | count towards the page limit 
  
  Submissions that violate any of these restrictions might be rejected without being reviewed.   
 Author Response Period  
 ASPLOS 2024 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting; see exact dates specified above. Authors should generally focus their rebuttal on (1) correcting factual errors in the reviews and (2) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. When a major revision is a realistic possibility, in addition to clarifying the submitted work, rebuttals may describe new experiments and data, if doing so addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Rebuttals are optional but strongly encouraged, and their absence might indicate to reviewers that authors are not interested in improving the work. There is no explicit word limit to a rebuttal, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep it under 800 words, and reviewers are not expected to read words that exceed this limit. Authors are not allowed to attach files to the rebuttal HotCRP comment.  
 Accepted Papers  
 Submissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page). We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot (unless all  authors have difficulty traveling due to such serious limitations as visa restrictions, care-giving responsibilities, and disability). By default, all accepted papers will be made available online to registered attendees before the conference at a date that depends on the review cycle. Papers accepted to the spring and summer deadlines will be published in separate volumes in advance of the conference.  
 ACM requires that all authors of accepted papers will adhere to the following policy. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors  to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  
 Artifact Evaluation  
 Artifact evaluation will continue in 2025 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the ASPLOS 2025 AEC  web page for more information.  
 Poster and Lightning Sessions  
 In addition to the regular presentations, the program may include poster and lightning sessions. If those are included, details can be found here when they become available.  
 Wild and Crazy Ideas Session  
 The program will also tentatively include a WACI session. Details will become available later.  
 Debate Session  
 Should the program include a debate session, details will be posted here.  
 Best Paper Award  
 The committee will select a handful of papers to receive a Best Paper Award. The decision may or may not be communicated to the winning authors prior to the official announcement at the opening session of the conference.  
 Program and Registration  
 Complete program and registration information will be available on the conference website as soon as it becomes available.  
 Confidentiality  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

 Call for papers   
 The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems and applications.  
   
  MobiCom’23 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand the more practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.  
   
  Unlike in previous years, MobiCom’23 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom'23 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and rebuttals as described below in more detail.

  Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision  
  
  MobiCom 2023 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal.  
   
  Rebuttals  
 MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow.  
   
  The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 1000 words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited or submitted after the rebuttal period.  
   
  Final decisions will be one of the following  
  
  Accept | : Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be | conditionally accepted | . The papers that go through a successful | anonymous | shepherding process will eventually be accepted. 
  Reject | : Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom. 
  One-Shot-Revision | : Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the | next | deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration. 
   
  Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers  
 The authors of accepted MobiCom 2023 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact Evaluation process can be found here.  
   
  Submission Instructions  
  
  All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the MobiCom ’23 paper submission website  . Authors should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind  reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.  
   
  Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: ​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed​.  You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​ online form  . After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.  
   
  Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:  
   
  Contain no more than | twelve (12) | single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Font size no smaller than | 10 points | . 
  Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
  Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches). 
  Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted. 
  Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity. 
  Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit. 
  You may find these templates  useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use ​ \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}​  . But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.  

  By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies  including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.  Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.  
   
  Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID  , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors  . The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.  

  Submission Policy  
  
  In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.  
   
  Previous Publications  
 We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., ""[7] Anonymized workshop paper"") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. ""This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ...""). In addition, the online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM Plagiarism Policy.  
   
  No Simultaneous Submissions  
 All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( ​ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions  ​) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected  from all conferences/journals involved.  
   
  The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.  
   
   Double-blind Submissions  
 All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution. They include but not limited to the below requirements: Please be sure your name and affiliation do not appear on the paper or in the submitted PDF file. This means that before submission, you must remove from the paper the authors' names, authors' affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources etc. 
  Please be cautious and careful how you refer to your own prior work in the paper. For example, do not describe your prior work with phrases like: | “In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol that …” | Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as | “In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol that …” | With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as | [3] Smith, J., ""Analysis of … "" | In particular, it is not acceptable to say | [3] Reference deleted for double-blind review. 
  Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of the paper. 
  Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
  We will not review any paper that violates our double-blind policy.  
   
  Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.  
   
   Conflict of Interest (CoI)  
 For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.  
   
  We generally follow the ACM policy ( Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications  ) and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at MobiCom ’23 as:  
  (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months  or reasonably expected within the next 12 months  ;  
  (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;  
  (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;  
  (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;  
  (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);  
  (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;  
  (8) others perceivable conflicts.  
   
  A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.  
   
  The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with any  author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.  
   
  Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI — e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews.  
   
   Previous Submissions  
 In case of any similarity between a current submission and a submission that has been previously rejected at MobiCom or other relevant conferences within the last 12 months, the authors are requested to do the following in three cases: For a one-shot revision, please carefully follow the instructions on the notification. Along with the resubmission, the authors must report the major concerns and requested items from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the revision. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been recently rejected by MobiCom, it is | required | for the authors to do the same as in case 1. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure | your anonymity | is retained in this summary. 
  For submissions that have been previously rejected by a conference other than MobiCom (such as Mobisys, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, UbiComp, etc.), it is | strongly encouraged | , although not required, for the authors to do the same items as in case 2. That is, please report the major concerns from the reviewers of the previous submission and write a summary of how the authors have addressed them in the current submission. Please ensure your anonymity is retained in this summary. 
   
   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers  
  
  Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding   
  Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member. Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions system.  
   
  Video Presentation   
  The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference. A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the conference.  
   
  Registration and Presentation   
  By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present it.  

  Awards  
  
  All accepted regular  papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award  .

  Call for  ISWC Notes and Briefs   

 Submissions Due: May 26, 2023 (11.59pm AoE)  
 ISWC 2023  , the 27th annual International Symposium on Wearable Computers, will be held in conjunction with UbiComp 2023 in Cancun, Mexico, October 8-12, 2023.  
 ISWC is the premier forum for research on wearable technology and topics related to on-body and worn mobile technologies. ISWC brings together an eclectic and interdisciplinary mix of visionary researchers, developers, designers, artists, manufacturers, and users to share information and advances in wearable technology. Contributions from a wide range of domains (including fashion design, computer science, textile engineering, electrical engineering, optics, human factors, sociology, anthropology, mechanical engineering, and medicine; among others) are encouraged.  
 ISWC invites submissions on all research related to technology that is worn on or interacts with the body, both the development and deployment thereof as well as the impacts and influences on individuals and cultures. ISWC looks for rigorous research contributions as well as highly creative ideas. Authors should consult the 2023 ISWC Author Guide  for more details.  
 While this call focuses specifically on research contributions, interested parties should be aware that other submission categories are also open for design innovation, system demonstrations, and interactive workshop formats (see our overall Call for Participation  for more information).

  Submission Types and Procedures  
 Notes & Briefs  
 ISWC accepts contributions of original, unpublished research in two lengths. Papers are published and archived in the ACM Digital  Library  .  
 Notes   :  novel, rigorous research contributions of smaller scope than full papers submissions to IMWUT  . Notes should reflect a more narrow research question, but not reflect early-stage (e.g. pilot, under-developed) research, or preliminary technological development without a robust evaluation.  Notes should not exceed 4 pages in the 2-column, ACM proceedings format  (please refer to the UbiComp/ISWC templates and formatting  ). References do not count to the page limit (i.e. references can be on pages 5+), but it is important that the core paper including all text and figures  is in the first 4 pages. Appendices are not allowed.  
 Briefs   :  novel research contributions of a narrow scope. Briefs should include system or technology development with limited evaluation. Briefs should not exceed 2 pages in the 2-column, ACM proceedings format  (please refer to the UbiComp/ISWC templates and formatting  ). References do not count to the page limit (i.e. references can be on pages 3+), but it is important that the core paper including all text and figures  is in the first 2 pages. Appendices are not allowed.  
 Former “  Long Papers”   : Since ISWC and UbiComp have started co-hosting the conference, papers formerly known as “Long papers” must be submitted via the IMWUT journal system  . IMWUT has 4 submission deadlines a year (15 February, 15 May, 15 August, 15 November). When submitting to IMWUT, please make sure you tick the “Wearable” checkbox  as it helps allocate the papers to suitable Associate Editors. More information about IMWUT submissions and their presentation is available here  .  
 ISWC 2023 contributions will be presented at the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 conference in Cancun, Mexico  , October 8-12, 2023   
 *ISWC Notes & Briefs, as any other track at UbiComp/ISWC 2023, will be in-person only.  
  More details for exceptions can be found here  .   
    
 Template for the Submission  
 Please refer to the UbiComp/ISWC template and formatting  .  
 Submission, Reviewing and Camera-ready Procedures  
 All papers should be sent through the submission site available through the Precision Conference System (PCS)  .  
 Double-blind review   :  ISWC follows a double-blind review process, and the anonymization policy of ACM IMWUT  should be observed. Therefore, submit your papers without identifying information (i.e. it must be anonymized), including author names and pay attention when citing prior work to use a style which does not lend to easy identification of the authors (i.e. in third person). For instance, instead of “In our previous work we showed….” one could write “It was recently shown that … [ref]”. Authors must leave citations to their previous work unanonymized to allow reviewers to ensure that the existing literature has been adequately taken into account. Any link to codes or visual materials (e.g., videos, images) needs to be anonymized too.  
 Accepted papers:   final edits (in alignment with reviewer comments) will be prepared by the authors for submission on the Camera Ready Deadline  .  
 Shepherded papers   :  those are papers which require very specific changes identified by reviewers and the program committee members. They are considered to be conditionally accepted, subject to the authors modifying their paper to address specific shepherding comments. These may fall in two categories. Some papers may be requested to be revised in a shorter format (e.g. from Notes to Briefs), while others may be requested to be revised in the same format. A shepherd will guide the authors to ensure that the required changes are adequately completed. Revision timelines will be agreed between the shepherd and authors, but must be fully complete and approved by the shepherd by the Shepherding Acceptance Deadline  and then readied for the Camera Ready Deadline  .  
 Rejected papers   : Some rejected papers may be invited for submission as posters or demonstrations at the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 Conference.  
 Desk Rejects   :  Papers out of the scope of ISWC or without appropriate anonymization may be rejected without reviews.  
 All papers well suited for the format may also be invited for an additional submission as a demonstration at the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 conference  .  
 Reviewing Criteria  
 All papers are reviewed based on their scientific merit and contribution to the scientific progress in the domain of wearable technology. Submissions should demonstrate novelty (contribution above the state of the art); impact (contribution that furthers the state of the art in meaningful and significant ways, that can be translated and applied to new contexts); and rigor (contribution that is thoroughly supported with well-constructed evidence).  
 For authors to get a sense of what the ISWC community likes to see in papers we may suggest consulting the 2023 ISWC Author Guide  .

 UbiComp / ISWC   

 Past Conferences   
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing ( UbiComp  ) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.   
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing ( ISWC  ) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.   
 A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

 10-Year Impact Award  
   
 The 10-Year Impact Award was awarded to  
 Roman Rädle, Hans-Christian Jetter, Nicolai Marquardt, Harald Reiterer, and Yvonne Rogers  for their work on  
 HuddleLamp: Spatially-Aware Mobile Displays for Ad-hoc Around-the-Table Collaboration   
 https://doi.org/10.1145/2669485.2669500   
  The Impact Award is awarded to a paper published at ISS (ITS in the past) a decade ago. This year’s award went to a paper published at ITS 2014. The Impact Award recipients were decided by a jury consisting of this year’s Papers Chairs (ISS 2023), Papers Chairs from ITS 2014, as well as senior members of the community.  
 The award is given to a paper that has had a significant impact on the ISS community, the broader human-computer interaction community, or the industry. The jury evaluated papers from a number of perspectives, like citations and how they developed over time, which venues and what kinds of papers were citing the work, and the extent of forward-thinking ideas, concepts, or prototypes that would later be adopted widely.  
   
 Roman Rädle (middle) attended the conference in person to receive the award from ISS 2023 Papers Co-Chairs, Ville Mäkelä (left) and Andrés Lucero (right).    
 Congratulations to the award recipients!

 Submission (tracks A and B): EasyChair ICALP 2023  
  
 Invited Speakers   
 Anna Karlin - University of Washington, USA  
 Rasmus Kyng - ETH Zurich, Switzerland  
 Rupak Majumdar - Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany  
 Thomas Vidick - California Institute of Technology, USA, and Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel  
 James Worrell - University of Oxford, UK  
  
 Submission guidelines   
 Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.  
 Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.  
 Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a fairly lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).  
  
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.  
 The submissions are done via Easychair to the appropriate track of the conference (see topics below). The use of pdflatex and the LIPIcs style are mandatory: papers that deviate significantly from the required format risk rejection without consideration of merit.  
 During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 22-25 to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.  
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.  
 Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.  
  
 Awards   
 During the conference, the following awards will be given:  
  
 the EATCS award  
 the Church prize  
 the Presburger award  
 the EATCS distinguished dissertation award  
 the best papers for Track A and Track B  
 the best student papers for Track A and Track B (see submission guidelines)  
  
 Proceedings   
 ICALP proceedings are published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. This is a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics. LIPIcs volumes are published according to the principle of Open Access, i.e., they are available online and free of charge.

 Deadline: Saturday 9 July 2022   
 Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL)  . It is an interdisciplinary conference, spanning across both basic and application oriented research in mathematical logic and computer science.  
 CSL'23 will be held on February 13 - 16, 2023, in Warsaw, Poland, with satellite workshops on February 17. It is planned as an on-site event, with support for remote presence for those participants who are unable to come for pandemic reasons. Keynote speakers: Claudia Faggian (Université de Paris, France), Nina Gierasimczuk (Danish Technical University, Denmark), Dale Miller (Inria Saclay, France), Michał Pilipczuk Pilipczuk (University of Warsaw, Poland) and Davide Sangiorgi (University of Bologna, Italy).  
   
 Authors are invited to submit contributed papers of no more than 15 pages in LIPIcs style (not including appendices or references), presenting unpublished work fitting the scope of the conference. Papers may not be submitted concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work submitted to a conference or a journal.  
 Submitted papers must be in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the Programme Committee to assess the merits of the paper. Full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at all members of the PC. The paper should be submitted via Easychair  .

 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 46th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as a hybrid conference – in person in Taiwan, with support for remote participation, from July 23rd to 27th, 2023. We welcome contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. The conference and program chairs invite those working in areas related to IR to submit high-impact original papers for review. Please note a CFP for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2023 venues will be released separately.  

 Important Dates  

 Time zone: Anywhere on Earth(AoE)    
  Full paper abstracts due: January 24, 2023  
  Full papers due: January 31, 2023  
  Full paper notifications: April 4, 2023  
  Camera ready papers: April 26, 2023  

 Publication date:  accepted papers will be published open access for one month on the ACM Digital Library up to two weeks prior to the conference opening date (exact date TBA)  
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 24, 2023 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 31, 2023 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from the other conferences to submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts (“placeholder abstracts”).  
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

 Submission Guidelines  

 See this brief checklist to strengthen an IR paper   , for authors and reviewers.  
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2023).  
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf   templates are available from the ACM Website   (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are not required for review but may be required if accepted and published by the ACM.  

 For LaTeX, the following should be used:  
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}  Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir23    
  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and present the work at the conference.  

 Anonymity  

 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. However, it is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If the paper is already on arXiv, please change the title and abstract so that it is not immediately obvious they are the same. Do not upload the paper to a preprint site after submission to SIGIR—wait until a review decision to avoid reviewers seeing the paper in daily digests or other places. Breaking anonymity puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.  
 Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy   before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. No changes to authorship   will be permitted for the camera-ready submission under any circumstance or after submissions close. So please, make sure you have them listed correctly when submissions close.  

 Desk Rejection Policy  

 Submissions that violate the preprint policy, anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty   , including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:  
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
  Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
  Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
  Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | submit source code for artifact review | . 
  Addition of authors after abstract submission. 
  Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
  Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty. 
  Lack of topical fit for SIGIR. 

 Relevant Topics  

 Relevant topics include:  
  Search and Ranking.  Research on core IR algorithmic topics, including IR at scale, such as:  
 Queries and query analysis (e.g., query intent, query understanding, query suggestion and prediction, query representation and reformulation, spoken queries). 
  Web search (e.g., ranking at web scale, link analysis, sponsored search, search advertising, adversarial search and spam, vertical search).

 About IWOCA  
 Since its inception in 1989 as AWOCA (Australasian Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms), IWOCA has provided an annual forum for researchers who design algorithms for the myriad combinatorial problems that underlie computer applications in science, engineering and business. Previous IWOCA and AWOCA meetings have been held in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, UK, and USA. Previous IWOCAs can be found at http://www.iwoca.org/   
 IWOCA 2023 will take place in the Magic School of Green Technologies in National Cheng Kung University   , Tainan, Taiwan.

   EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation -formerly known as EvoWorkshops- brings together researchers in applications of Evolutionary Computation and other Nature-inspired techniques.  
 EvoApplications invites high quality contributions for its 26th edition, which will be held as part of the EvoStar 2023 event and co-located within EvoStar with three related conferences: EuroGP, EvoCOP and EvoMUSART.  
 The aim of EvoApplications is to create a friendly environment that can lead to the establishment or strengthening of scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.  
 Therefore, EvoApplications solicits high-quality original research papers (including significant work-in-progress) on any aspect of applications of Evolutionary Computation, both to real-world or methodological contexts in which Evolutionary Computation can contribute to pushing the limits of the state of the art beyond the present ones.  
 We encourage you to submit papers focused on interesting, relevant and original works that are related to all kinds of applications of Evolutionary Computation.

   The 23rd European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains.  
 Successfully solved problems include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, stringology, graphs, satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, planning and search-based software engineering.  
 The EvoCOP 2023 conference will be held together with EuroGP (the 26th European Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (the 12th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 26th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar (Evo*).  
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Previous proceedings can be found in the EvoCOP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink  .

 ISSTA/ECOOP'23: Welcome to Seattle and logistics  
   
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 We look forward to welcoming you to the joint conference next week.  
 Below are a number of logistical notes as well as guidelines for presenters. (For convenience, this and other communications will appear on the conference website as well.)  
 On behalf of the ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 organizing committee, welcome to Seattle!  
 René Just  
 Light Rail   
 The Seattle Light Rail system is a great option to get around the Seattle area and to the University of Washington. There is a station conveniently located at the SeaTac airport (from baggage claim, head up to 4th floor and use the skybridge to cross to the parking garage, and follow signs to Link Light Rail), and the line goes directly to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. Light Rail and bus tickets can be easily purchased via the Transit GO Ticket app  or at ticket kiosks located in the station. Light Rail tickets are $7 for all day use, or $2.25 to $3.50 per one-way trip.  
 Bus   
 Seattle has extensive bus route systems. You can use Seattle Metro’s convenient Trip Planning site  to plan your route. Tickets can be purchased via the Transit GO Ticket app  or with $2.75 exact change when boarding the bus.  
 Parking on Campus   
 Paid parking is available on the University of Washington campus. If you are driving to campus, it is recommended to factor in 20-30 minutes for finding parking and walking to your destinations, as the Allen and Gates buildings are 0.4 miles (0.6 km) from all parking garages. Information about parking fees can be found on ]UW’s Transportation]( https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor  ) website. Parking permits can be purchased at UW Gatehouses or by phone via the PayByPhone App  .  
 Addresses   
 Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering (Allen Center) 185 E Stevens Way NE Seattle, WA 98195  
 Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science and Engineering (Gates Center) 3800 E Stevens Way NE Seattle, WA 98195  
 (The two buildings are adjacent, though the street numbers may suggest otherwise.)  
 Registration   
 Please pick up your conference badge and registration package at the registration desk in the Allen Center. Just enter the building through the sliding doors, and the reception desk will be in front of you. The registration desk will be staffed between 8am and 5pm, Monday through Thursday, and between 8am and noon on Friday.  
 Technical Program   
 You can find a program overview and details for the entire week on the ISSTA/ECOOP website  . (The programs on the ISSTA and ECOOP website instances are in sync with the overall program, but provide a view that is tailored to each conference.)  
 Guidelines for presenters   
 In-person presentations:  Presentation slots are 15 minutes (unless differently indicated by your track chair). Please follow the instructions provided to you by your track chair to allow for enough time for Q&A. Please go to your allocated room 15 minutes before the session start time to meet with the Session Chair (see technical program), review the pronunciation of your name, and familiarize yourself with the room and A/V set up, if needed (see Rehearsal and equipment check). You are expected to use your own laptop for presentations, which needs to be connected via HDMI. Some dongles (USB-C) may be available but bring your own adapter if needed. For ISSTA and ECOOP presentations, the A/V system is set up such that it will capture the screen, presenter, and audio, which will be streamed for remote participants via Zoom. Note that you do not need to join a Zoom meeting, simply plug in your device and use the wireless microphone provided. 
  ISSTA-Online presentations:  Presentation slots are 10 minutes. Prepare for 7.5 minutes of presentation and 2.5 minutes of Q&A. You will be required to present via Zoom. Please join the zoom meeting for your online session 15 minutes before the session start time. The zoom meeting details will be shared separately before the main conference. To avoid complications, please install the latest Zoom application on your computer and do not present via a web browser. Make sure your Zoom setup is working properly by running the Zoom audio/video test before joining the call. If your presentation contains any audio, you must enable the sharing of audio when sharing your screen. When you have finished your presentation, please stop sharing your screen and mute your microphone. 
  Posters:  Please set up your poster on Tuesday between 3pm and 3:30pm in the Allen Atrium (in time for the first poster session that starts at 3:30pm). All posters can remain in the Allen Atrium until Thursday evening. Easels, poster boards (32x40 inches), and clips will be provided. 
  Rehearsal and equipment check:  We have reserved room G04 for presentation rehearsal and equipment testing. The A/V setup is identical in all conference rooms. If your set up works in G04, it should work everywhere. 
  Need Help?   
 Signs and student volunteers (in purple shirts) will guide you and help you find your way around campus. If you need additional help or support, please let a staff member at the registration desk know or email April and René.  

 Online sessions and Zoom links  
   
 Dear ISSTA/ECOOP 2023 participants,  
 Below are four meeting links for joining the conference remotely, grouped by conference room. These links are valid for the entire week, and each meeting will start at 10:15am (PDT) on any given day. Please see the online program  for details regarding sessions, rooms, and presentation order.  
 For online presenters   
 Please make sure to virtually join your meeting room 15 minutes prior to the start of your session to connect with your session chair and a student volunteer in the (physical) conference room.  
 For in-person participants   
 All remote presentations are streamed in the physical conference rooms (in the order as listed in the program). In-person participants will be able to ask questions using a wireless microphone and do not need to connect to Zoom.

 DATE 2025 - Call for Papers   
 The DATE conference is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors as well as specialists in the hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems. DATE puts a strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems as well as embedded software.  
 The three-day event consists of a conference with regular papers, late breaking results papers and extended abstracts, complemented by timely keynotes, special days, focus sessions, embedded tutorials, half-day workshops and multi-partner project sessions. The event will also host the Young People Programme and unplugged sessions fostering the networking and the exchange of information on relevant issues, recent research outcomes and career opportunities.  
 DATE 20 25   is the 28th edition of an event that has always been the place for researchers, young professionals and industrial partners to meet, present their research and discuss the current development and next trends, with high emphasis on social interaction.  
 At DATE 20 25   , the DATE community, again, comes together for the conference in an intensive three-day format, focussing on interaction as well as further strengthening the community. The vast majority of regular papers will be presented in technical sessions using short flash-presentations, where the emphasis is on poster-supported live interactions (in addition to the common full-length presentation videos available before, during and after the conference). By this, we continue to focus on the core value of conferences: meeting, discussing and exchanging.

 The Conference  
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research.  
  Special Days on Emerging Topics  
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues.  
 Special Day ""New Trends in AI/ML""  
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics:  
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
  Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
  AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
  Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
  During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed.  
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day.  
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

  Special Day ""Emerging Computing Paradigms""  
 -formerly ""Unconventional Computing""-   
  Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions.  
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

  Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design”  
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

  Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing  
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created.  
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session.  
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

  Camera-Ready and Presentation  
 Authors of accepted papers will prepare the camera-ready version of the paper, adhering to the IEEE proceedings format and will be checked through PDFeXpress. A recorded video presentation of the paper is also required, according to guidelines that will be made available. It should be noted that accepted Late Breaking Results papers will be published as submitted and are expected to be camera-ready, i.e., no separate camera-ready submission will be possible.  
 Registration Rule for All Accepted Papers  
 Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the paper author rate (i.e., two paper author registrations are needed for two accepted papers, e.g., from the main author or a co-author of the paper). DATE is a physically held conference, and not a hybrid conference.  Therefore, it is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested, otherwise the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards (despite full payment at the paper author rate).  
  Focus Sessions  
 Focus Sessions can take the form of (1) Panels, discussing visionary and controversial issues or (2) Hot-Topic Sessions, focusing on the introduction and discussion of new R&D problems, addressing trends in the technical domains that are of interest to the conference participants.  
 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted at https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/  by Friday, 11 October 2024 AoE  . The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal by Tuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE  . In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts by Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  . Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that the Friday, 17 January 2025 AoE  deadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference.  
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions   
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following:  
 Session Chair/Co-Chair  : Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

 ICPP 2023  
 International Conference on Parallel Processing  

 Register for ICPP    

  Call for Papers  
 ICPP, the International Conference on Parallel Processing, provides a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to present their latest research ﬁndings in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. ICPP is one of the oldest computer science conferences; ICPP 2023 is the 52nd edition of ICPP.  
  
  ICPP2023 will be held in Salt Lake City, UTAH, USA, from August 7th to 10th, 2023  . ICPP 2023 is a premier venue for presenting the latest research on all aspects of parallel processing. Topics of interest in ICPP 2023 papers include, but are not limited to:  
 Algorithms: | Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Combinatorial & Numerical Methods, Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel and Distributed Applications and Platforms, Algorithmic Innovations for Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning. 
  Applications: | Parallel and Distributed Applications, Scalable Data Analytics & Applied Machine Learning, Computational and Data-Driven Science & Engineering (e.g., Astrophysics, Computational Chemistry, Bioinformatics, Climate Science, Finance, Geology). 
  Architecture: | Micro-Architecture for Parallel Computing, Parallel Computer Architecture and Accelerator Designs, LArge-Scale System Architectures, Datacenter/Warehouse Computing Architecture, Machine Learning Architectures, Architectural Support for Networking, New Memory Technologies, Near-Memory Computing, Parallel I/O, Architectures for Edge Computing, Architectural Support for Reliability and Security. 
  Multidisciplinary: | Innovation combining multiple disciplines, Cross-Cutting Research (e.g., Complex Workﬂows Combining Data Analytics and/or AI/ML with Traditional Simulations), Use of Known Algorithms in Novel/Emerging Applications, Methodologies for Performance Portability and/or Productivity across Architectures. 
  Performance: | Performance Modeling of Parallel or Distributed Computing, Performance Evaluation of Parallel or Distributed Systems; Scalability, Simulation Models, Analytical Models, Measurement-Based Evaluation. 
  Software: | Systems Software, Middleware, Runtime Systems, Parallel and Distributed Programming Languages & Models, Programming Systems, Compilers, Libraries, Programming Infrastructures and Tools, Operating and Real-Time Systems. 
   
  Submission Guidelines  
 Paper submissions should not exceed 10 pages (including references)  and all submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission portal ( https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp  ) in PDF format printable on US letter size (8.5"" x 11"") paper. Please use the ACM format located at: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  . More speciﬁcally, we recommend using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} conﬁguration for submissions prepared in LaTex. Changes to the template (e.g., margin, font size) could lead to automatic rejection. Up to two additional pages may be subsequently purchased (if needed) for the camera-ready version. Submissions should represent original research results and cannot already be under review or accepted for publication in another venue.  
  
  The review process is double-anonymous  , so submissions should not  reveal the identity of the authors. Authors should leave out author names, aﬃliations, and (any) acknowledgment from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person  (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors with further questions about double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.  
  
  The ICPP 2023 technical program includes a reproducibility initiative  , where the submitters will be given an option to submit details about the artifacts that enable their experiments to be reproduced. A reproducibility submission consists of the description of the computational artifacts (up to two pages appendix) and persistent and permanent links to the computational artifacts submission ( more information regarding the ICPP reproducibility initiative here  ). The submission of the reproducibility artifacts will be voluntary, but their presence will be an advantage during the decision process compared to submissions with equivalent ratings without artifacts. We also plan to have rebuttals  only for papers that do not have a clear accept or reject decision.""  
  
  All accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will also need to follow the conference registration policy to be included in the conference proceedings. We will oﬀer rejected papers an opportunity to be forwarded to workshop organizers to be considered in one of the workshops if the authors choose to do so.

The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions). 
  Consequently, it is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person, unless clear and extenuating circumstances prevent attendance. 
  As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts for at least one of you to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed). 
  Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible. 
  These decisions about remote presentation will be made two weeks before the conference begins. 
  The conference proceedings will be finalized after the conference based on the papers presented. 
  A registration fee is required for all accepted papers, regardless of attendance.

  Remote Presentation Option:  LCN considers in-person meetings indispensable for collaborations, personal exchanges, discussions, and networking opportunities. Recognizing the evolving landscape of academic conferences and the need for flexibility, LCN 2024 introduces a Remote Presentation Option.  
 Upon acceptance/registration, authors have the option to select physical or remote presentation modes. When opting for remote presentation, a fee of 500 USD is required in addition to the author registration. This fee covers supplementary costs associated with providing a remote option. The additional fee for remote presentations may be waived when all authors are from countries marked with an asterisk on the following list of IEEE eMembership Countries: https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/emember-countries.html  .  
 Remote presentation is restricted to full, short, and doctoral papers. Further implementation details will be communicated as part of the author and presenter instructions.  
 The overarching goal of LCN 2024 is to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of LCN, catering to a diverse global audience while preserving the value of physical participation.

   The 8th IFAC Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC) , 17th IFAC Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS) , 5th IFAC Workshop on Linear Parameter Varying Systems (LPVS)  , will be held jointly in Montreal, Canada, on September 27-30, 2022. For call for papers see here   . Preliminary program posted, see under Program tab.    
 Initial submission deadline is April 15, 2022   May 9, 2022  . Final Submission Deadline August 31, 2022  . Submission link at Paperplaza  can be found here  . Contributions can be submitted as either an discussion paper (2 pages) or a full paper (8 pages initial submission, 6 pages final submission).  
 The joint conference is planned to be an in-person event, to be held at Sheraton Hotels by Marriott in downtown Montreal between September 27-30, 2022. Please note that the event can be switched to a virtual/hybrid event if the global pandemic conditions do not allow for in-person meetings.  
 The aim of this joint event is to gather academics and professionals with a special interest on system structure, control, linear and nonlinear system theory, and to offer them a forum where to discuss current research developments and open problems as well as to establish scientific networks with a focus on the mathematical structure of systems as well as on the limits it imposes on control systems design and performance.  

 Starting with 2013, the Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC) and the Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS) take place in the framework of “joint IFAC Conferences”. The novelty of this joint event is that it will include also the Workshop on Linear Parameter Varying Systems (LPVS). The present joint conference aims to achieve the same high quality standard of IFAC. As for the previous editions, the National Organizing Committee (NOC) and the Program Editor are the same for the “joint IFAC Conference” and the registration fees are unique for the whole event, allowing the participants to follow sessions of any of the symposium (SSSC) and workshops (TDS, LPVS). The joint conference is structured across multiple tracks, each of them incorporating several special or regular sessions, poster sessions and industry presentations and demonstrations. The paper proposals will undergo a standard peer reviewing process. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings, which will be published in IFAC PapersOnLine.

 Welcome to The  
  Web Conference 2023 in  
  Austin, Texas, USA  
 April 30 - May 4, 2023  
 AT&T Hotel and Conference Center at The University of Texas at Austin

  INTRODUCTION  
 Since the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989, The Web Conference (formerly known as International World Wide Web Conference, abbreviated as WWW) is a yearly international academic conference on the topic of the future direction of the World Wide Web. This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web.  
 The 2023 ACM Web Conference will offer a high quality program made of research sessions, posters and demonstrations, a PhD symposium for the junior scholars, workshops, tutorials, a developers track for the practitioners as well as thought provoking keynote speakers, panels, special track on web for good, History of the Web, and colocated special days.  
 The 2023 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with virtual components  including live streaming of ceremonies and keynotes, access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees.  
 All speakers, presenters, organizers participating in any way at The Web Conference are expected to attend the conference in person. For exceptional reasons, if you are not able to attend in person to present, you may assign a proxy who must be in person. For special cases, we may make an exception for a live remote presentation.  
   
  (UPDATE: As of April 26, due to logistical situations, we are not able to accommodate anymore remote presentations)   
 Austin is honored and thrilled to host The Web Conference and is preparing an exceptional conference for sharing the latest insights of academic and industrial research. We thank you for your participation and look forward to seeing you in Austin!

 Cliff B. Jones: Understanding Programming Languages   
 Springer, November 2020, 229 pp, ISBN: 978-3-030-59256-1. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59257-8   
 Summary  
 The book Understanding Programming Languages  by Cliff B. Jones is about the formal specification of the semantics of programming languages. It focuses on the structural operational semantics of imperative and sequential languages, including features such as blocks and procedures, with an extension to concurrent objects at the end of the book. The material is presented with great clarity and requires almost no background knowledge, making the book perfectly suitable for any person curious about programming languages and seeking a deeper understanding of how they work. This book is also for language designers, as being formally precise is an invaluable tool to help catch design issues early in the design phase.

  About ArtsIT
2023   

 The ArtsIT conference
brings together a wide array of cross-/inter-/trans-disciplinary researchers,
practitioners, artists, and academia to present and discuss the symbiosis
between art (in its widest definition) and information technology applied in a
variety of distinct fields. Since 2009 ArtsIT has become acknowledged as a
leading scientific forum for the dissemination of cutting-edge research results
in the intersection between art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and
technology. The role of artistic practice using digital media is also to serve
as a tool for analysis and critical reflection on how technologies influence
our lives, culture, and society. ArtsIT is therefore not only a place to
discuss technological progress but also a place to reflect on the impact of art
and technology on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. Besides
the main track, the event also focuses on the advances seen in diverse areas
that have significantly contributed to the field in the last years, namely,
Digital Musical Interfaces, virtualization and artificial intelligence with
special sessions.  

 Campinas is a
Brazilian city located in the southeast region of São Paulo State and is
situated a few kilometers from the Tropic of Capricorn, which crosses São Paulo
State. It is the first Brazilian city to become a metropolis without being a
capital, exerting significant national influence. The city is home to several
universities, including UNICAMP, the State University of Campinas, ranked among
the top five universities in Latin America. In only 57 years, this university
has achieved international recognition by fulfilling its mission of building
and disseminating knowledge and innovation. 


 This year, ArtsIT is
hosted by NICS, the Interdisciplinary Nucleus of Sound Studies, as part of its
40th anniversary. Formed in 1983, NICS’ primary objective is to research
different manifestations of sound, in all its aspects and applications, as a
source of informational, cognitive, and creative content. The nucleus was
founded with a vocation for interdisciplinary research, addressing innovative
themes for the time that continue to be updated, including sound pollution,
analysis of sounds in Brazilian forests, phonetics of their fauna and native
populations, electronic music, and ethnomusicological records.

Abstract The popularity of chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has brought research attention to question answering systems, capable to generate natural language answers to user's natural language queries. However, also in other kinds of systems, flexibility of querying, including but also going beyond the use of natural language, is an important feature. With this consideration in mind the paper presents a critical and comprehensive analysis of recent developments, trends and challenges of Flexible Query Answering Systems (FQASs). Flexible query answering is a multidisciplinary research field that is not limited to question answering in natural language, but comprises other query forms and interaction modalities, which aim to provide powerful means and techniques for better reflecting human preferences and intentions to retrieve relevant information. It adopts methods at the crossroad of several disciplines among which Information Retrieval (IR), databases, knowledge based systems, knowledge and data engineering, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the semantic web may be mentioned. The analysis principles are inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) framework, characterized by a top-down process, starting with relevant keywords for the topic of interest to retrieve relevant articles from meta-sources And complementing these articles with other relevant articles from seed sources Identified by a bottom-up process. to mine the retrieved publication data a network analysis is performed Which allows to present in a synthetic way intrinsic topics of the selected publications. issues dealt with are related to query answering methods Both model-based and data-driven (the latter based on either machine learning or deep learning) And to their needs for explainability and fairness to deal with big data Notably by taking into account data veracity. conclusions point out trends and challenges to help better shaping the future of the FQAS field.

Overview
The RECOMB conference series, established in 1997, serves as a premier scientific forum for the exchange of advancements in computational biology and its applications in molecular biology and biomedicine. The conference acts as a bridge, connecting computational, mathematical, statistical, and biological sciences. It assembles researchers, professionals, students, and industrial practitioners from across the globe for interaction and exchange of the newest developments in all areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. The conference features keynote talks by leading scientists, presentations of peer-reviewed high-quality research papers, presentations of exciting research developments that were published within the past year, and poster sessions showcasing the latest research progress.
Topics
Papers reporting on original research (both theoretical and applied) in all areas of computational molecular biology are suitable for submission. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to (in no particular order):
Molecular sequence analysis
Sequencing and genotyping technologies
Gene regulation and epigenomics
Transcriptomics
Single-cell omics
Metagenomics and microbiome analysis
Population genetics and statistical genomics
Evolution and comparative genomics
Structure and function of non-coding RNAs
Computational proteomics and proteogenomics
Computational structural biology
Computational metabolomics
Protein structure and function
Biological networks and network biology
Computational systems biology
Multimodal data integration in biological research
Computational approaches to understanding human disease
Data privacy and security in biomedical research
Bioimaging and molecular and cellular imaging analysis
Submission Guidelines
Submissions should represent original and previously unpublished work. Each submission will be rigorously reviewed by the Program Committee. Selected papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume as part of the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series from Springer-Verlag, which will be available at the conference. Authors who prefer not to publish their full papers in the LNBI proceedings should submit a final extended abstract for inclusion in the Springer LNBI proceedings in lieu of the full paper. In addition, they must submit the full paper to the preprint servers arxiv.org or bioRxiv.org by the deadline of the camera-ready version to ensure the accepted paper is accessible.
Submission deadlines:
Abstract/paper registration deadline : October 16, 2023 AoE October 23, 2023 AoE
Full paper submission deadline : October 20, 2023 AoE November 3, 2023 AoE (updates to registered abstracts only)
Paper submission:
Please submit your papers through EasyChair at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2025 .
Abstract registration:
There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline on October 23, 2023 AoE, four days prior to the full paper submissions deadline. This deadline allows the Program Committee to begin planning review assignments ahead of full paper submissions. After the abstract submission deadline has passed, new submissions will not be accepted, but authors can update the full paper submission before the paper submission deadline on November 3, 2023 AoE. Please ensure the abstract registration closely aligns with full paper submission in terms of title, author list, and abstract content. ""Placeholder"" abstract registrations without meaningful descriptions will not be accepted. While minor updates to the abstract are allowed before the full paper submission deadline, any substantial changes to the title or abstract content risk being removed without consideration.
Formatting instructions for paper submission:
Main paper format: All paper submissions must be in PDF format. The maximum length is 10 Letter pages , including all figures/tables and their captions, using a minimum font size of 10pt and 1-inch margins . An additional title page containing the paper title, author list, and abstract is permitted. The bibliography does not count toward the page limit. Submissions that violate the formatting requirement (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or exceed the page limit may be rejected without review. There is no specific template requirement beyond these guidelines, but authors are encouraged to use the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science template available here .

Optional Appendix: If necessary, an Appendix can be submitted as Supplementary Material in a single PDF file. The Appendix should contain materials directly supporting the paper content. There is no page limit for the Appendix, but please note that reviewing the Appendix is at the discretion of the reviewers.

Source code availability: Importantly, if the paper involves the development of new software or analysis methods, the source code should be made publicly accessible via a GitHub repository, which should be sufficiently complete by the submission deadline for reviewers to examine. The link to this repository must be clearly indicated in the paper.
Journal publication:
RECOMB is partnering with Cell Systems , Genome Research , and the Journal of Computational Biology . Authors of selected accepted papers will be invited, but not required, to submit a revised version of their paper for a special issue in one of the partnering journals. These journals will require some expansion of the RECOMB accepted papers. Preprint server submissions are allowed without restrictions. Submissions to peer-reviewed journals other than the partnering ones are also allowed ; however, authors should note that 'double-dipping' is not permitted. If an author has a paper that is submitted elsewhere in parallel, or intends to be submitted in parallel, they are required to withdraw that paper from the full publication in the proceedings immediately upon acceptance, and opt for the extended abstract option, along with the mandatory preprint server submission.
All accepted submissions to RECOMB will be considered for the RECOMB special issues of Cell Systems and Genome Research. Authors will be notified of whether their paper is accepted for oral presentation at RECOMB and simultaneously whether it is being further considered for expedited review by Cell Systems or Genome Research upon RECOMB acceptance notification. In addition to the RECOMB reviewers, the editors of Cell Systems and Genome Research, as well as potentially 1-2 additional reviewers with particular knowledge of the biological applications addressed, will be actively engaged in those accepted RECOMB papers being considered for Cell Systems and Genome Research, respectively.

Best Industry Related Paper Award
Home » Awards » ICPR Awards » Best Industry Related Paper Award

The Best Industry Related Paper Award will be awarded at each ICPR. The paper will be selected by a committee appointed by the Chair of the Industry Liaison Committee.

The award is given to a paper selected for oral presentation at ICPR, where at least one of the authors is from a company or technology transfer organization.

The award is officially announced at the conference dinner. However, there is traditionally a Best Industry Related Paper Award session during the conference some time before the dinner, where the nominees discuss the relation between academic and industrial research. The BIRPA award winner is unofficially announced at this session.
Award Procedure
The ICPR paper submission system needs to allow authors to self-nominate for the award, where one author must be from a company or a technology transfer organization. Purely university author lists are not eligible. The Program Chair is responsible for ensuring the submission system allows self-nomination.
Once paper acceptances are announced and the 'camera-ready' versions of the papers are submitted, the ILC Chair asks the Program Chair for the list of and PDFs of the highly ranked self-nominated oral papers, along with the reviews for those papers.
Each ILC member gets (3*num_papers/committee_size) revised papers to read, along with the original reviews. The ILC member does not need to write anything, but is asked to rank the papers in order of best to worst. There is a 3 week deadline. The papers are 6 pages long, so this should take maybe 5 hours.
From the ranked papers, the ILC chair selects the top 5(ish) based on the preliminary rankings. The whole ILC reads these and ranks them again. There is a 3 week deadline.
From these final rankings, a consensus ordering is formed. The ILC Chair keeps the committee informed about the process.
The Chair passes the selected winner's details to the IAPR's Secretary and the IAPR office.
The Chair and ICPR Program Chair schedule a 1 hour award session, where the nominees will be asked to give a 5 minute presentation on the relation of research and industry. There will be a panel discussion afterwards, and then finally the announcement of the BIRPA prize. The presentation and panel discussion is not a factor in the award decision.

UbiComp / ISWC

Past Conferences
The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing ( UbiComp ) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.
The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing ( ISWC ) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.
A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

BTW Konferenz: Business, Technologie und Web

Die BTW ist die bedeutendste Tagung zu Datenbanken und deren Anwendungen im deutschsprachigen Raum. Sie findet seit 1985 alle zwei Jahre statt.

Die BTW nahm ihren Anfang zu einer Zeit, in der sich Datenbanksysteme von den klassischen betrieblichen Einsatzfeldern zu Anwendungen in Büro, Technik und Wissenschaft entwickelten, daher der Name BTW. Seit der 10. BTW in Leipzig (2003) steht die Abkürzung BTW für Datenbanksysteme für B usiness, T echnologie und W eb. Inhaltsangaben zu den bisherigen Tagungen finden sich auf den DBLP-Seiten . Alle Papiere mit Zitierungsangaben finden sich zudem in einem eigenen Google Scholar- Profil.
Die bisherige Entwicklung der BTW wird in folgenden Artikeln beschrieben:
T. Härder, E. Rahm: | 30 Jahre „Datenbanksysteme für Business, Technologie und Web | "". Datenbank-Spektrum, 2015
A. Blaser: | Die BTW im Wandel der Datenbank-Zeiten | . Datenbank-Rundbrief 16:3–33, 1995

In unserem Veranstaltungsarchiv finden Sie weitere vergangene Veranstaltungen.

Zwecke im Rahmen Ihrer Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 a DSGVO)

Eine Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten für bestimmte Zwecke (z. B. Nutzung Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse für Mitgliederinformationen, Newsletter) kann auch aufgrund Ihrer Einwilligung erfolgen. In der Regel können Sie diese jederzeit widerrufen. Dies gilt auch für den Widerruf von Einwilligungserklärungen, die vor der Geltung der DSGVO, also vor dem 25. Mai 2018, uns gegenüber erteilt worden sind. Über die Zwecke und über die Konsequenzen eines Widerrufs oder der Nichterteilung einer Einwilligung werden Sie gesondert im entsprechenden Text der Einwilligung informiert.
Grundsätzlich gilt, dass der Widerruf einer Einwilligung erst für die Zukunft wirkt. Verarbeitungen, die vor dem Widerruf erfolgt sind, sind davon nicht betroffen und bleiben rechtmäßig.

Zwecke zur Erfüllung gesetzlicher Vorgaben (Art. 6 Abs. 1 c DSGVO) oder im öffentlichen Interesse (Art. 6 Abs. 1 e DSGVO)

Wie jeder, der sich am Wirtschaftsgeschehen beteiligt, unterliegen auch wir einer Vielzahl von rechtlichen Verpflichtungen. Primär sind dies gesetzliche Anforderungen (z. B. Handels- und Steuergesetze), aber auch ggf. aufsichtsrechtliche oder andere behördliche Vorgaben. Zu den Zwecken der Verarbeitung gehören ggf. die Identitäts- und Altersprüfung, die Erfüllung steuerrechtlicher Kontroll- und Meldepflichten sowie die Archivierung von Daten zu Zwecken des Datenschutzes und der Datensicherheit sowie der Prüfung durch Steuer- und andere Behörden. Darüber hinaus kann die Offenlegung personenbezogener Daten im Rahmen von behördlichen/gerichtlichen Maßnahmen zu Zwecken der Beweiserhebung, Strafverfolgung oder Durchsetzung zivilrechtlicher Ansprüche erforderlich werden.

Die von uns verarbeiteten Datenkategorien, soweit wir Daten nicht unmittelbar von Ihnen erhalten, und deren Herkunft

Soweit dies für die Erbringung unserer Dienstleistungen erforderlich ist, verarbeiten wir von anderen Unternehmen oder sonstigen Dritten (z. B. Auskunfteien) zulässigerweise erhaltenepersonenbezogene Daten. Zudem verarbeiten wir personenbezogene Daten, die wir aus öffentlich zugänglichen Quellen (wie z.B. Telefonverzeichnisse, Handels- und Vereinsregister, Presse, Internet und andere Medien) zulässigerweise entnommen, erhalten oder erworben haben und verarbeiten dürfen.
Relevante personenbezogene Datenkategorien können insbesondere sein:
Personendaten (Name, Beruf/Branche und vergleichbareDaten)
Kontaktdaten (Adresse, E-Mail-Adresse, Telefonnummer und vergleichbare Daten)
Adressdaten (Meldedaten und vergleichbareDaten)
Zahlungs-/Deckungsbestätigung bei Bank- und Kreditkarten
Mitgliederhistorie
Daten über Ihre Nutzung der von uns angebotenen Telemedien (z.B. Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs unserer Webseiten, Apps oder Newsletter, angeklickte Seiten/Links von uns bzw. Einträge und vergleichbareDaten)

Empfänger oder Kategorien von Empfängern Ihrer Daten

Innerhalb unseres Hauses erhalten diejenigen internen Stellen bzw. Organisationseinheiten Ihre Daten, die diese zur Erfüllung unserer vertraglichen und gesetzlichen Pflichten oder im Rahmen der Bearbeitung und Umsetzung unseres berechtigten Interesses benötigen. Eine Weitergabe Ihrer Daten an externe Stellen erfolgt ausschließlich
im Zusammenhang mit der Vertragsabwicklung;
zu Zwecken der Erfüllung gesetzlicher Vorgaben, nach denen wir zur Auskunft, Meldung oder Weitergabe von Daten verpflichtet sind oder die Datenweitergabe im öffentlichen Interesse liegt (vgl. Ziffer 2.4);
soweit externe Dienstleistungsunternehmen Daten in unserem Auftrag als Auftragsverarbeiter oder Funktionsübernehmer verarbeiten (z. B. externe Rechenzentren, Unterstützung/Wartung von EDV-/IT-Anwendungen, Archivierung, Belegbearbeitung, Datenvernichtung, Einkauf/Beschaffung, Mitgliederverwaltung, Lettershops, Marketing, Abrechnung, Telefonie, Webseitenmanagement, Wirtschaftsprüfungsdienstleistung, Kreditinstitute, Druckereien oder Unternehmen für Datenentsorgung, Kurierdienste, Logistik);
aufgrund unseres berechtigten Interesses oder des berechtigten Interesses des Dritten für im Rahmen der unter ""Zwecke im Rahmen eines berechtigten Interesses von uns oder Dritten "" genannten Zwecke (z. B. an Behörden, Auskunfteien, Inkasso, Rechtsanwälte, Gerichte, Gutachter, konzernangehörige Unternehmen und Gremien und Kontrollinstanzen);
wenn Sie uns eine Einwilligung zur Übermittlung an Dritte gegeben haben.
Wir werden Ihre Daten darüber hinaus nicht an Dritte weitergeben. Soweit wir Dienstleister im Rahmen einer Auftragsverarbeitung beauftragen, unterliegen Ihre Daten dort den gleichen Sicherheitsstandards wie bei uns. In den übrigen Fällen dürfen die Empfänger die Daten nur für die Zwecke nutzen, für die sie ihnen übermittelt wurden.

Dauer der Speicherung Ihrer Daten

Wir verarbeiten und speichern Ihre Daten für die Dauer unserer Geschäftsbeziehung. Das schließt auch die Anbahnung eines Vertrages (vorvertragliches Rechtsverhältnis) und die Abwicklung eines Vertrages mit ein.
Darüber hinaus unterliegen wir verschiedenen Aufbewahrungs- und Dokumentationspflichten, die sich u. a. aus dem Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) und der Abgabenordnung (AO) ergeben. Die dort vorgegebenen Fristen zur Aufbewahrung bzw. Dokumentation betragen bis zehn Jahre über das Ende der Geschäftsbeziehung bzw. des vorvertraglichen Rechtsverhältnisses hinaus.
Ferner können spezielle gesetzliche Vorschriften eine längere Aufbewahrungsdauer erfordern, wie z.B. die Erhaltung von Beweismitteln im Rahmen der gesetzlichen Verjährungsvorschriften. Nach den §§ 195 ff. des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches (BGB) beträgt die regelmäßige Verjährungsfrist zwar drei Jahre; es können aber auch Verjährungsfristen von bis zu 30 Jahren anwendbar sein.
Sind die Daten für die Erfüllung vertraglicher oder gesetzlicher Pflichten und Rechte nicht mehr erforderlich, werden diese regelmäßig gelöscht, es sei denn, deren - befristete - Weiterverarbeitung ist zur Erfüllung der aufgeführten Zwecke aus einem überwiegenden berechtigten Interesse erforderlich. Ein solches überwiegendes berechtigtes Interesse liegt z.B. auch dann vor, wenn eine Löschung wegen der besonderen Art der Speicherung nicht oder nur mit unverhältnismäßig hohem Aufwand möglich ist und eine Verarbeitung zu anderen Zwecken durch geeignete technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen ausgeschlossen ist.

Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten in einem Drittland oder durch eine internationale Organisation

Eine Datenübermittlung an Stellen in Staaten außerhalb der Europäischen Union (EU) bzw. des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR) (sogenannte Drittländer) erfolgt dann, wenn es zur Ausführung eines Auftrages/Vertrags von bzw. mit Ihnen erforderlich sein sollte, es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist (z.B. steuerrechtliche Meldepflichten), es im Rahmen eines berechtigten Interesses von uns oder eines Dritten liegt oder Sie uns eine Einwilligung erteilt haben.
Dabei kann die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten in einem Drittland auch im Zusammenhang mit der Einschaltung von Dienstleistern im Rahmen der Auftragsverarbeitung erfolgen. Soweit für das betreffende Land kein Beschluss der EU-Kommission über ein dort vorliegendes angemessenes Datenschutzniveau vorliegen sollte, gewährleisten wir nach den EU-Datenschutzvorgaben durch entsprechende Verträge, dass ihre Rechte und Freiheiten angemessen geschützt und garantiert werden. Entsprechende Detailinformationen stellen wir Ihnen auf Anfrage zur Verfügung.
Informationen zu den geeigneten oder angemessenen Garantien und zu der Möglichkeit, eine Kopie von Ihnen zu erhalten, können auf Anfrage beim betrieblichen Datenschutzbeauftragten angefordert werden.

Ihre Datenschutzrechte

Unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen können Sie uns gegenüber Ihre Datenschutzrechte geltend machen
So haben Sie das Recht, von uns | Auskunft | über Ihre bei uns gespeicherten Daten nach den Regeln von Art. 15 DSGVO (ggf. mit Einschränkungen nach § 34 BDSG) zu erhalten.
Auf Ihren Antrag hin werden wir die über Sie gespeicherten Daten nach Art. 16 DSGVO | berichtigen | , wenn diese unzutreffend oder fehlerhaft sind.
Wenn Sie es wünschen, werden wir Ihre Daten nach den Grundsätzen von Art. 17 DSGVO | löschen | , sofern andere gesetzliche Regelungen (z.B. gesetzliche Aufbewahrungspflichten oder die Einschränkungen nach § 35 BDSG) oder ein überwiegendes Interesse unsererseits (z. B. zur Verteidigung unserer Rechte und Ansprüche) dem nicht entgegenstehen.
Unter Berücksichtigung der Voraussetzungen des Art. 18 DSGVO können Sie von uns verlangen, | die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten einzuschränken | .
Ferner können Sie gegen die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten Widerspruch | nach Art. 21 DSGVO einlegen, aufgrund dessen wir die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten beenden müssen. Dieses Widerspruchsrecht gilt allerdings nur bei Vorliegen ganz besonderer Umstände Ihrer persönlichen Situation, wobei Rechte unseres Hauses Ihrem Widerspruchsrecht ggf. entgegenstehen können.
Auch haben Sie das Recht, Ihre Daten unter den Voraussetzungen von Art. 20 DSGVO in einem strukturierten, gängigen und maschinenlesbaren | Format zu erhalten | oder sie einem | Dritten zu übermitteln | .
Darüber hinaus haben Sie das Recht, eine erteilte | Einwilligung | in die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten jederzeit uns gegenüber mit Wirkung für die Zukunft | zu widerrufen | (vgl. Ziffer 2.3).
Ferner steht Ihnen ein | Beschwerderecht bei einer Datenschutzaufsichtsbehörde | zu (Art. 77 DSGVO). | Wir empfehlen allerdings, eine Beschwerde zunächst immer an unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten zu richten.
Ihre Anträge über die Ausübung ihrer Rechte sollten nach Möglichkeit schriftlich an die oben angegebene Anschrift oder direkt an unseren Datenschutzbeauftragten adressiert werden.

Umfang Ihrer Pflichten, uns Ihre Daten bereitzustellen

Sie brauchen nur diejenigen Daten bereitstellen, die für die Aufnahme und Durchführung einer Geschäftsbeziehung oder für ein vorvertragliches Verhältnis mit uns erforderlich sind oder zu deren Erhebung wir gesetzlich verpflichtet sind. Ohne diese Daten werden wir in der Regel nicht in der Lage sein, den Vertrag zu schließen oder auszuführen. Dies kann sich auch auf später im Rahmen der Geschäftsbeziehung erforderliche Daten beziehen. Sofern wir darüber hinaus Daten von Ihnen erbitten, werden Sie auf die Freiwilligkeit der Angaben gesondert hingewiesen.

Bestehen einer automatisierten Entscheidungsfindung im Einzelfall (einschließlich Profiling)

Wir setzen keine rein automatisierten Entscheidungsverfahren gemäß Artikel 22 DSGVO ein. Sofern wir ein solches Verfahren zukünftig in Einzelfällen doch einsetzen sollten, werden wir Sie hierüber gesondert informieren, sofern dies gesetzlich vorgegeben ist. Unter Umständen verarbeiten wir Ihre Daten teilweise mit dem Ziel, bestimmte persönliche Aspekte zu bewerten (Profiling). Um Sie zielgerichtet über Leistungen informieren und beraten zu können, setzen wir ggf. Auswertungsinstrumente ein. Diese ermöglichen eine bedarfsgerechte Leistungsgestaltung, Kommunikation und Werbung einschließlich Markt- und Meinungsforschung.

Information über Ihr Widerspruchsrecht Art. 21 DSGVO

Sie haben das Recht, jederzeit gegen die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten, die aufgrund von Art. 6 Abs. 1 f DSGVO (Datenverarbeitung auf der Grundlage einer Interessenabwägung) oder Art. 6 Abs. 1 e DSGVO (Datenverarbeitung im öffentlichen Interesse) erfolgt, Widerspruch einzulegen, wenn dafür Gründe vorliegen, die sich aus Ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben. Dies gilt auch für ein auf diese Bestimmung gestütztes Profiling im Sinne von Art. 4 Nr. 4 DSGVO. | Legen Sie Widerspruch ein, werden wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr verarbeiten, es sei denn, wir können zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Verarbeitung nachweisen, die Ihre Interessen, Rechte und Freiheiten überwiegen, oder die Verarbeitung dient der Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen.
Wir verarbeiten Ihre personenbezogenen Daten ggf. auch, um Direktwerbung zu betreiben. Sofern Sie keine Werbung erhalten möchten, haben Sie jederzeit das Recht, Widerspruch dagegen einzulegen; dies gilt auch für das Profiling, soweit es mit solcher Direktwerbung in Verbindung steht. Diesen Widerspruch werden wir für die Zukunft beachten. | Ihre Daten werden wir nicht mehr für Zwecke der Direktwerbung verarbeiten, wenn Sie der Verarbeitung für diese Zwecke widersprechen.

Der Widerspruch kann formfrei erfolgen und sollte möglichst gerichtet werden an
Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.
Ahrstraße 45, 53175 Bonn
